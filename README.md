# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
NASA APOD Search

Uses NASA's API to search for the Astronomy Picture of the Day. Once opened, press start then the current APOD is loaded. You can also search by date. All searches are prepended to the top of the page. Reset button clears the page of all searches. 

I do plan on working on this more eventually...
